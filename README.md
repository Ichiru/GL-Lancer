GL-Lancer
=========

An OpenGL clone of Freelancer written in C# based on MonoGame and Starchart

How you can help
=========
Right now I need people who can do the following:
* People who can _debug_ on both Mac OSX and Windows (means you need MonoDevelop 4+)
* People who can dissect the various Freelancer file formats (.thn files aren't supported at all at the moment)
* People who are good at maths etc. (for Physics)

System requirements
=========
* Windows Vista+ / Recent Linux with SDL2 installed
* A card capable of OpenGL 3.0 (most cards, make sure drivers are updated)
* .NET Framework 4.0+ / Mono 2.10+
* MonoDevelop 4+ / Non-express version of Visual Studio 2010
